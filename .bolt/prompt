For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

optimization sequence to have a low latency to be applied anytime possible:

Bundle Analysis

First understand your current bottlenecks
Identify unnecessary dependencies
Remove or replace heavy libraries
Understand actual performance constraints

Code Splitting

Break down large applications
Implement lazy loading for routes/components
Reduce initial bundle size
Improve first meaningful paint time

Performance Optimization

Reduce unnecessary re-renders
Optimize component lifecycle methods
Use memoization techniques
Improve React render efficiency

Caching Strategies

Implement client-side caching
Configure service workers
Set up proper HTTP caching headers
Reduce repeated network requests

Network & Asset Optimization

Compress and optimize assets
Use modern image formats
Implement CDN for static assets
Minimize external resource loading
